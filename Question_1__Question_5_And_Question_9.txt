ANSWER NO 05:
Like other languages (C, C++, Java), whenever a variable is created, each variable has an associated data type. In Dart language, there is the type of values that can be represented and manipulated in a programming language.

DATA TYPES:
1. Number: The number in Dart Programming is the data type that is used to hold the numeric value.
   SYNTAX: num variable_name = variable_value;
   EXAMPLE num num_one = 15;

2. String: It used to represent a sequence of characters. It is a sequence of UTF-16 code units. The keyword string is used to represent string literals. String values are embedded in either single or double-quotes. 
   SYNTAX: String variable_name = "variable_value";
   EXAMPLE String stu_name = "Kashif";

3. Boolean: It represents Boolean values true and false. The keyword bool is used to represent a Boolean literal in DART. 
   SYNTAX: bool variable_name = true or false;
   EXAMPLE bool stu_name = (age == 15);


4. List: List data type is similar to arrays in other programming languages. A list is used to represent a collection of    objects. It is an ordered group of objects. 
   SYNTAX: List<datatype> variable_name = [variable_value];
   EXAMPLE List<int> age = [15,16,17]


5. Map: The Map object is a key and value pair. Keys and values on a map may be of any type. It is a dynamic collection.
